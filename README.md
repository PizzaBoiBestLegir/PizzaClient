pizza client is a mod for minecraft 1.8.9 hypixel skyblock and it has macro/hacks for most things in hypixel

Most notable features: (all auras and nukers use fake rotation packets) -Qol ice fill (still somewhat wip, works great for 150 or less ping) -Spirit Bear Aura (with triggerbot once a spirit bear spawns) -Simon Says Aura -Good Terminals -Mithril Macro -Gemstone Macro (still wip) -Nuker (good to use on hypixel) -Powder Macro (everything automatic, uses nuker for the block breaking) -Crop Aura (auto places any crop)

All macros have failsafes, for example player detection or stop when getting warped out -Auto Enchanting -Auto Book Combine -Auto Salvage -Shoot terminator when left clicking with valk -Gemstone ESP -Hide Golden Goblins -Powder Chest Macro (there's also a mode to only use fake rotation to solve it) -Item Keybinds -Commission Esps -Alot of dungeon Esps -Auto Wardrobe -Anti sessionid stealer (works for getSessionID and getToken, still somewhat WIP?)

There's still a shit ton more features, like a shit ton of esps and shit, but i cba mentioning them
